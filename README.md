# Reflection
- Building this app helped me understand how JavaScript interacts with the DOM.
At first, getting the edit and delete buttons to work correctly was a challenge,
especially while keeping everything synced with localStorage.

I solved most issues by testing my code in CodePen, where I could instantly see results and fix errors faster.
It made experimenting and debugging much easier before moving my final code into VS Code.

I also learned how to break problems into smaller parts and test each step before adding new features.
This approach helped me stay organized and build confidence in how the browser and JavaScript work together.
In the end, I’m proud that everything works smoothly.
